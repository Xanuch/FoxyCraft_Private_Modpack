# FoxyCraft_Private_Modpack
Xanny's Private-but-stillsomewhatavailable MC Modpack. Frequent  updates as it happens.

Seriously. If you aren't joining my server, you shouldn't have this.

However, it's just a massive pack I had to put together because I hate how every pack distribution is entirely behind versions, all the time.
I do some testing, do the updates, and stick it in. Don't like updates? I don't care. 

It's my pack, and I'm not going to pay to have it not be hidden. 




All pull requests, if made, will be denied and blocked. 

It's my pack, and I'm not going to bother having people fuddle with it. Unless it's fixing something.
