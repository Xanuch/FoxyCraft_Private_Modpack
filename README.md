# FoxyCraft Private Modpack
#  THIS PACK IS INTENDED FOR PRIVATE USE.

This pack was put together without permissions, however, only entitled for private use and kept centralized for private use on this github. There is no copyrights here, but each mod author is entitled to tell me otherwise. Seriously. I don't use github this way normally other than being an autoupdating SVN manager, so lemme know if I'm breaking some serious ToS. (Non mod-author based, naturally.)

I wanted a giant modpack that isn't going to be out of date for months, and it bothers me. So I made my own. This is only up here, for the sake of syncing a large pack, and the updates thereof. For any reason that people that aren't the mod authors' mods and addons contained in this pack want to white knight me about it. Please, refer to this. I don't care. This is intended for private use, and outlined by 90% or so of what I see for permissions, this isn't for public use. 


If you find some sorta bug. Be nice, report a bug. It's a private pack but it's not perfectly made. I'm only foxy.
You can be useful, but I'll know if you screw with it.
